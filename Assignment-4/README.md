# Data augmentation, generalization, network initialization techniques

* **Implemented various regularization techniques and verified accuracy before and after applying these techniques.**

a) l1 l2

b) dropout

c) earlystop

d) montecarlo dropout

e) various initializations and when to use what

f) batch norm

g) custsom dropout, custom regularization

Tensor Board is used to visualize the epoch accuracy and epoch loss.
